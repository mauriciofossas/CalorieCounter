Simple calorie counter app; users may enter a daily caloric allowance, or obtain their suggested caloric allowance through 
their Basal Metabolic Rate (by inputting height, weight, age, and sex). Users then may add foods and their allowance will be 
reduced.
The main objective of this project is to explore basic android application structure and functionality.
