In terms of running issues; I had quite a few issues with Android Studio where certain files would duplicate after running the app, so if you run into this when grading, the solution is to go to Build -> Clean project and then run it on the emulator and it should be fine.

Creative portion:
I implemented a feature which tells people what their suggested intake of calories should be (relative to their age, weight, height, and sex). I implemented this feature because it seemed reasonable that someone may not have a pre-set goal of caloric intake or knows what his/her calorie intake should look like. I determine the suggested caloric intake based on the basal metabolic rate (all formulas and calculations can be found here: http://www.checkyourhealth.org/eat-healthy/cal_calculator.php). Suggested caloric intake is also dependent on activity, but for simplicity (and to avoid using to many if-else statements) I just assumed a midpoint between "lightly active" and "moderately active" ((1.375+1.55)/2). 
I implemented my creative portion by having an extra button in the initial dialog box which asks if you wish to see your suggested intake. This button opens another dialog box which prompts the user for their weight in pounds, height in inches, and age in years (I put some constraints on these to make sure the values were reasonalbe; 0.5 < weight < 3000, 3 < inches < 120, 0 <= years < 200). They then click on their sex, male or female, which both have an event listener and these then open yet another dialog box which gives the user their basal metabolic rate and suggested caloric intake, they then have the option to use this suggested intake or type in their own.
